This project implements a deep learning-based image enhancement pipeline designed to improve low-field (LF) MRI scans for early, non-hospitalizing detection of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD). Using a Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN), the framework enhances the quality of LF MRI scans to approximate high-field (HF) MRI quality, which enables better downstream segmentation and diagnosis.
